# Introduction
**ShapeKit** is a plug-and-play post-processing toolkit that enables researchers and clinicians to correct anatomical errors in AI-predicted segmentations without retraining models. It integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines and supports robust, anatomy-aware refinement across multiple organs and datasets.

Using a parallelized Python workflow, ShapeKit combines, calibrates, and refines multi-organ segmentations, leading to up to **15% improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)** and producing consistent outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

# Installation

To set up environment, see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/BodyMaps/ShapeKit/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md) for details.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BodyMaps/ShapeKit.git
cd ShapeKit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Use ShapeKit

<details>
<summary style="margin-left: 25px;">Organize your data</summary>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
    
```bash
INPUT or OUTPUT
└── case_001
    ├── combined_labels.nii.gz (optional)
    └── segmentations
            ├── liver.nii.gz
            ...
            └── veins.nii.gz
```
</div>
</details>

```bash
export INPUT="/path/to/your/input/folder"
export OUTPUT="/path/to/your/output/folder"
export CPU_NUM=16
export LOG="logs/folder_named_after_your_task"

python -W ignore main.py --input_folder $INPUT --output_folder $OUTPUT --cpu_count $CPU_NUM --log_folder $LOG --continue_prediction
```

The processing process will be recorded as `debug.log` and `postprocessing.log`,and are stored under the directory `LOG`.

# Plug-and-Play Configuration
Tell ShapeKit which anatomical structures you are interested in by modifying the `config.yaml` file.

<details>
<summary style="margin-left: 25px;">Check for details 🔍</summary>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">

### How to choose your interested anatomical structures:

Open the `config.yaml`file and list the anatomical structures you want to process under `target_organs`. It’s as easy as checking boxes on a form.

```
# plug-and-play like Lego! choose organs for processing

target_organs: (example)
  - bladder
  - colon
  - duodenum
  - femur
  - intestine
  - kidney
  - liver
  - lung
  - pancreas
  - vertebrae
```

**<mark>For detailed configuration setting, please check [the config instructions 🌞](docs/config.md)</mark>.**.

Before running any commands, please ensure that `config.yaml` is properly configured. But don't worry! **Most of the configurations do not need to be changed at all.**

# Evidence-Gated Vertebrae Engine (ShapeKit-Pro)

The default vertebrae module works from the masks alone. ShapeKit can now
optionally repair vertebrae against the case **CT image** with an
evidence-gated engine that **recolors label errors inside the prediction
envelope instead of deleting bone**:

- fragments are re-attached through CT-certified bone corridors, never
  discarded when they are real bone;
- level-band mass misassignment (e.g. a collapsed L1 split between
  neighbors) is re-arbitrated at image-detected disc planes;
- the posterior arch is rebuilt from pedicle roots, and one-level-down
  spinous chains on fused spines are repaired by a caudal-flow
  re-derivation;
- every risky stage carries its own defect meter and **reverts itself**
  when it cannot prove improvement, so one parameter set is safe across
  clean and pathological cases at scale.

Enable it in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
vertebrae_engine: shapekit_pro   # default: shapekit_songlin (existing module)
ct_file_name: ct.nii.gz          # looked up inside each input case folder
# ct_root: /path/to/ct/cases     # fallback root when CTs live elsewhere
```

No new dependencies (numpy, scipy, nibabel, scikit-image and
connected-components-3d are already required). CPU only; ~2 min for a
2.5 mm case and ~30 min for a 0.7 mm whole-spine case on 2 cores, with a
peak of roughly 9 GB on the latter — budget `--cpu_count` accordingly.
When a case has no reachable CT the engine logs it and falls back to the
default vertebrae module, so batch runs never stall.

Measured on the AbdomenAtlasDemo cases (identical parameters, per-stage QA
and verification tooling in the
[ShapeKit-Pro repository](https://github.com/aj-das-research/jhu-bodymaps-warmup)):
both cases reach zero structural audit flags (fragmentation, ordering,
size, emptiness; exactly 24 components), the collapsed L1 is restored from
23.3 to 62.9 cm3 at detected disc planes, and every spinous process is
re-attached to its own vertebra on the fused case.

# Iterative Vertebrae Engine (ShapeKit-Iterative)

In addition to the default and Pro vertebrae engines, ShapeKit now offers a
**VerSe-inspired iterative refinement** module that runs an anatomic
consistency cycle on the predicted vertebrae masks alone (no CT required):

- **residual reassignment** — recovers unassigned spine voxels and
  reassigns them to the nearest vertebra by 3D centroid distance;
- **gap detection & filling** — detects anomalously large Z-axis gaps
  between consecutive vertebrae and assigns residual components to the
  missing level;
- **fishing for boundary vertebrae** — extrapolates beyond the detected
  inferior/superior boundaries to recover L5 or C1 when missing;
- **duplicate removal** — merges overlapping detections via IoU thresholding;
- **anatomical size consistency** — validates vertebrae sizes against
  region-group medians (lumbar > thoracic > cervical) and removes outliers;
- **iterative convergence** — repeats the full clean → reassign → fill →
  reallocate loop until the change rate drops below 1% or max iterations
  (3) are reached.

This module is adapted from Meng et al., "Vertebrae localization,
segmentation and identification using a graph optimization and an
anatomic consistency cycle" (2022,
[https://gitlab.inria.fr/spine/vertebrae_segmentation](https://gitlab.inria.fr/spine/vertebrae_segmentation)).

It is the default option in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
vertebrae_engine: shapekit_songlin   # default option for vertebrae processing
```

No CT image is needed — the module works from prediction masks alone.
Output is compatible with the existing 26-based label scheme
(26 = L5 … 49 = C1). Verified to produce identical results to the
SuPreM standalone postprocessing pipeline on the AbdomenAtlasDemo
benchmark cases.

# Key Functions

## Optional anatomical vertebrae refinement

Set `vertebrae_engine: anatomical_refinement` in `config.yaml` to run the
mask-only warm-up solution contributed by Yixiao Liu. This option preserves
the standalone algorithm and uses the reference image's physical geometry.
Existing engine defaults remain unchanged.
In addition to these general utilities, anatomical-structures-specific correction functions are available in [organs_postprocessing.py](organs_postprocessing.py).

Please check the details in [functions guide book 📖.](docs/functions.md)
